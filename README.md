## Project Description

_Project 360_ is an interactive and immersive 3D collaborative interior designer web app that empowers users to create and design customized interior spaces. The app offers users the option to select from preset canvases such as bedrooms, living rooms, or to define the size of the canvas themselves. With a vast array of placeable items and furniture to choose from, including essentials like chairs, desks, and beds, as well as decorative items like plants and paintings, users can bring their vision to life with ease.

Users can view their canvas spaces from a 360-degree camera perspective, which is navigable by dragging the screen with a mouse. Additionally, users can toggle between a 360-camera view or a first-person view for a more immersive experience. Collaboration between users is made possible, with up to 3-4 people per canvas. This feature allows users to place items together in real time, offering a dynamic and social experience for designing interior spaces.

_Project 360_ also includes an invitation system, allowing users to invite collaborators to their canvases via email. Users can save and export their canvases as SVL or PDF files. With these export options, users can easily share their designs with others, making it a valuable tool for professionals in the interior design industry or anyone looking to create a virtual space for a project.

Overall, _Project 360_ is an innovative and user-friendly web app that offers an engaging and collaborative experience for designing and visualizing interior spaces in 3D.
